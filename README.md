# Ilex 6502
## An MOS 6502 assembler and emulator

This project began as my own effort to better understand the MOS 6502 instruction set. I figured writing an assembler would be a terrific way to grok the addressing modes and internalize the instructions.

Perhaps some day I'll get back to writing that Atari 2600 game.
